# Ansible vaults are used to encrypt sensitive information
# we can encrypt inventory.txt as below
# ansible-vault encrypt inventory.txt
# When we try to run the playbook as below
# ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i inventory.txt we will get an error
# not able to decrypt the inventory csvfile
# for that we have to use as below
# ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i inventory.txt -ask-vault-pass

# Instead of prompting for the password, we can store the password
# in a file and send file as vault-password-csvfile

# ansible-playbook.yml playbook.yml -i inventory.txt -vault-password-file vault_pass.txt

# Instead of passing the plain txt file, we can pass the script which retrieves other
# password from a secured location

# ansible-playbook.yml playbook.yml -i inventory.txt -vault-password-file vault_pass.py

# to view the contents of encrypted file use:
# ansible-vault view inventory.txt

# to create a encrypted file use
# ansible-vault create inventory.txt
